Hi, Iâ€™m @ZajacPi
I study automation and robotics, which means I'm interested in software, mechanics and electronics, but my projects usually revolve around what interests me currently the most.
Uhhh other than that I'm not an engineer yet but I like to tell people that I am.

Feel free to use any of my files or reach out to me!
Peace and love
